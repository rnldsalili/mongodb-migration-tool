# Parallel Processing & Logging Improvements

## What's New

### ‚úÖ **Improved Parallel Processing**
- **Even Distribution**: Collections are evenly distributed among workers (round-robin)
- **Real-time Tracking**: Each worker reports its progress individually
- **No Race Conditions**: Removed spinners that were conflicting with each other
- **Clear Worker Assignment**: Shows which collections each worker will process

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Logging**
- **Worker Identification**: All logs include worker ID for easy tracking
- **Readable Timestamps**: Simplified timestamp format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **Progress Phases**: Clear indication of worker start, processing, and completion
- **Detailed Summaries**: Success/failure counts with worker identification

## Example Output

### Worker Assignment Phase
```
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:09 - üë• Starting 3 workers:
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:09 -    Worker 1: 2 collections [users, categories]
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:09 -    Worker 2: 2 collections [products, reviews]
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:09 -    Worker 3: 2 collections [orders, inventory]
```

### Processing Phase
```
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:09 - üîÑ Worker 1 started processing 2 collections
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:09 - üì¶ Worker 1: Starting dump of collection 'users'
[SUCCESS] 2025-07-25 11:36:10 - ‚úÖ Worker 1: Successfully dumped collection 'users'
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:10 - üì¶ Worker 1: Starting dump of collection 'categories'
```

### Completion Phase
```
[SUCCESS] 2025-07-25 11:36:11 - ‚úÖ Worker 1: Successfully dumped collection 'categories'
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:11 - üèÅ Worker 1 completed processing 2 collections
[INFO]  2025-07-25 11:36:11 - üìä Dump Summary: 6 successful, 0 failed
```

### Error Handling
```
[ERROR] 2025-07-25 11:36:10 - ‚ùå Worker 2: Failed to dump collection 'products': Connection timeout
[WARN]  2025-07-25 11:36:11 - ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed collections:
[WARN]  2025-07-25 11:36:11 -   - Worker 2: products - Connection timeout
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Visibility**: You can see exactly what each worker is doing at any time
2. **Easier Debugging**: Failed operations show which worker encountered the issue
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track which workers complete first/last
4. **Progress Tracking**: Clear indication of overall progress across all workers
5. **No Log Conflicts**: No more overlapping spinner output or confusing messages

## Testing

Run the parallel processing test to see the new logging in action:
```bash
bun run test-parallel
```

This simulates parallel processing with realistic timing and occasional failures to demonstrate the logging capabilities.
