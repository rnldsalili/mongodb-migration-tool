# Enhanced Collection Selection

## What's New

### ✅ **Interactive Collection Selector**
- **Removed "All Collections" Option**: No more separate "all" option in the list
- **Toggle All with "a" Key**: Press "a" to select/unselect all collections dynamically
- **Visual Navigation**: Arrow keys for navigation with cursor indicator
- **Individual Selection**: Space bar to toggle individual collections
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live counter and preview of selected collections

### ✅ **Improved User Experience**
- **Clear Visual Indicators**: ☑️ for selected, ☐ for unselected
- **Cursor Navigation**: ▶ shows current position
- **Color Coding**: Selected collections appear in green
- **Selection Counter**: "Selected: X/Y collections" display
- **Selection Preview**: Shows selected collection names at bottom

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑/↓` | Navigate up/down through collections |
| `Space` | Toggle selection of current collection |
| `a` | Toggle all collections (smart toggle) |
| `Enter` | Confirm selection and proceed |
| `q` | Quit/cancel selection |
| `Ctrl+C` | Force quit |

## Smart Toggle Behavior

The "a" key implements smart toggle logic:
- **If no collections or some collections are selected**: Select all collections
- **If all collections are selected**: Unselect all collections

## Example Interface
